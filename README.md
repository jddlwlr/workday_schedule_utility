## Code

This application features many lines of code, most of which would be unnecessary if the development team had realized they were headed down a long, tedius road and decided to turn back early, or at least had not felt the overwhelming weight of _sunk-costs_ as they continued to edit variables and functions. A for-loop or two would _not_ have killed them. They are committed to doing better... next time. 

### Limitations

This application can only display one day, as the current day, no matter how badly you want to add things to do tomorrow and beyond. The development team has heard feedback that this is a serious limitation, and is taking expanding the functionality under advisement-- don't hold your breath.
